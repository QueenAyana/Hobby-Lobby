# Hubble.com

# Where we can help you expand your bubble to fit a new hobby!

Hubble.com is a React.js based application designed to help people find hobbies based on their "personality". We created a series of questions for the user to answer. After the survey is taken we assign the user a personality and a list of hobbies that are most likely to be of interest ti them. We also plan to implement the use of Meetup.com's API to help them find groups or events related to the hobbies they matched with.
